**Hello World, Welcome to the ELMAGIC PyTorch Experiments Repository!**

This repository contains PyTorch code to reproduce the key experiments and results presented in the paper: **ELMAGIC: Energy-Efficient Lean Model for Reliable Medical Image Generation and Classification Using Forward Forward Algorithm**.

Here, you will find implementations of:

*   **Forward-Forward Algorithm (FFA):** Training with positive and negative passes for energy efficiency.
*   **Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation (MTKD):** Distilling knowledge from ResNet-18 (Teacher1) and a smaller CNN (Teacher2) into a Lean Student model.
*   **Iterative Magnitude Pruning:** Techniques to reduce model size and improve efficiency while maintaining performance.
*   **Experiments on Medical Image Datasets:** Code for ODIR-5K (Ocular Disease Recognition) and HAM10000 (Skin Lesion Classification) datasets.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:** Calculation of F1 Score, AUC-ROC, and FID score for performance evaluation.
*   **Code to Generate Figures:** Scripts to reproduce Figures 2 and 3 from the paper, showcasing comparative analysis of algorithms, MTKD evaluation, and pruning effects.

This repository aims to provide a clear and reproducible codebase for researchers and practitioners interested in energy-efficient deep learning for medical image analysis.
